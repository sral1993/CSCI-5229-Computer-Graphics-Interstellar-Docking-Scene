In this project, I have tried to mimic the interstellar docking scene. The key steps according to the movie is as follows:
1. Dr.Mann a  bad scientist attempts to make an un-authorized docking. After he reaches the dock position, he explodes and his ranger destroys and also damages few parts of endurance.
2. Because of the damage and inertia of motion, the endurance slips out of orbit by translation and rotation.
3. Dr.Cooper a good scientist who is in another ranger tries to dock the endurance(because endurance is required for future) by translation into the docking position and rotates to match the endurance RPM.
4. Once the RPM is matched the endurance was pulled out of the orbit by Dr.Cooper Ranger.

Project Objectives(as mentioned in the project proposal) and Results :

1. Creation of Endurance with 3D objects                                  : Successfully created (improved complexity after project review)
2. Creation of Ranger with 3D objects                                     : Successfully created
3. Applying Lighting concepts to the scene                                : Successfully done (implemented after project review)
4. Apply textures for Space and Earth                                     : Successfully done
5. Apply textures for Endurance and Ranger                                : Successfully done
6. Controlling different views using up/down arrows                       : Yes
7. Controlling RPM of both endurance and Ranger using keys                : RPM's are controlled by the program.
8. Controlling the movement of Ranger towards endurance using keys        : Successfully done

Stretch goals:

1. Endurance slips out of orbit by translation and rotation               : Successfully done (implemented after project review)
2. Dr.Cooper's Ranger tries to dock by translation and rotation           : Successfully done (implemented after project review)
3. Manual docking of Dr.Cooper's Ranger with endurance                    : Successfully done (implemented after project review)

Super Stretch goals:

1. Creation of Dr.Mann ranger and he tries to dock and fails              : Successfully done (implemented after project review)
2. Synchronization of all of the events in a perfect order                : Successfully done (implemented after project review)
3. Reset/Restart the entire docking scene with automation                 : Successfully done (implemented after project review)
